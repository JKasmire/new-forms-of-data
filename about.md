# Meet the Team

### Dr Julia Kasmire

Julia is a Research Fellow at the UK Data Service based at University of Manchester. She has experience in linguistics, computational social science and complex system engineering and approaches her current role as an interesting opportunity to combine thinking like a computer (essential for data sciences) with thinking like a human (essential for social sciences). She also applies her experience and interest to the topic by understanding the skills of computational social science as adaptations within the complex and evolving system that is the modern world, in which both data and people matter a great deal. 

She is deeply committed to equality, diversity and inclusivity and is currently dabbling with stand-up comedy as a form of science communication.
